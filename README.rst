 Snackabra Web Client
======================

For general documentation on Snackabra see:

* https://snackabra.io

If you would like to contribute or help out with the snackabra
project, please feel free to reach out to us at snackabra@gmail.com or
snackabra@protonmail.com


Introduction
============

This react native web client can connect to any Snackabra server -
public or private.

To run your own private "room server", you can install:

* https://github.com/snackabra/snackabra-roomserver


Setup
=====

You need to copy the template ".env" file to the root:

::

   cp setup/template.env .env

See below (Private Servers) for details: this file points your
webclient to your preferred ``snackabra`` servers (room and storage).

Once done, you can simply:

::

   yarn install
   yarn build
   yarn start

If you're changing messages in the UI, you will occasionally need:

::

   yarn extract
   yarn compile

To maintain the internationalization setup (though currently we
only support the ``en`` locale).

For development, one suggestion is to install the React Native Chrome
Extension [#f01]_ and then open developer tools. When running the
extension against your local version (``yarn start``), you get the
"developer" build, and against your server you'll get "production"
build (which can also be tested locally).



Private Servers
===============

By default this build will point your web app to the
https://Privacy.App servers, you can change this in the env file:

If you are running your own snackabra room server, you will need to
replace ``REACT_APP_ROOM_SERVER`` with the domain - it'll be something
like ``r.example.workers.dev``.

You can run a personal room server and still use public storage
servers, but you will only be able to read files, not upload. If you
want to be able to share photos and files, you will need your own
storage server as well, and set ``REACT_APP_STORAGE_SERVER`` to point
to it.

Of course you can also point it to any other public host as well. [#f02]_


Hosting your Client
===================

After ``yarn build``, you will have a set of static images (in the
'build' directory), that you can host in various ways. If you're
setting up the storage and room servers on Cloudflare, then
it might be simplest if you use Cloudflare "Pages". Detailed
documentation of how to do that is beyond the scope, but
it's pretty straightforward:

* First fork a copy for yourself of 'snackabra-webclient'

* On Cloudflare, select connecting to GitHub and authorizing
  it to you your forked repository.

* A Framework Preset, select "Create React App" as your choice.

* Change the Build command (which uses ``npm`` by default) to be just
  ``yarn build``
  
* In the Enviroment Variables, add ``NODE_VERSION`` with value ``16``.

Then build and deploy. If you are running your own
servers, you will also have to override the defaults in
the ".env" file.

It'll take a few minutes for most of the steps, in total it should
take less than 10-15 minutes.

Reminder: if you are setting up your own domain ("acme.com"), then
you should end up with something like this:

::

   acme.com    -> will server the static pages of this (web) client
   r.acme.com  -> this runs your snackabra-roomserver
   s.acme.com  -> this runs your snackabra-storageserver


Notes
=====

The snackabra web (app) client is a reference fully featured
web client for the snackabra set of communication and data
sharing services. You can use it to connect to any rooms
on https://privacy.app or you can configure it to connect
to any snackabra server, including personal server.

The app is written in (mostly) React Native and based on the
(exellent) Gifted Chat code. [#f03]_ For a few reasons, we are
currently using a slightly modified fork. [#f04]_
